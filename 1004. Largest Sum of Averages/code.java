//We partition a row of numbers A into at most K adjacent (non-empty) groups, 
//then our score is the sum of the average of each group. What is the largest score we can achieve?

//Note that our partition must use every number in A, and that scores are not necessarily integers.

//Example
//Example 1
//
//Input: 
//[9,1,2,3,9]
//3
//Output: 20
//Explanation: 
//The best choice is to partition A into [9], [1, 2, 3], [9]. The answer is 9 + (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 + 9 = 20.
//We could have also partitioned A into [9, 1], [2], [3, 9], for example.
//That partition would lead to a score of 5 + 2 + 6 = 13, which is worse.

//Example 2
//
//Input:
//[9,3]
//2
//Output: 12

//Notice
//1 <= A.length <= 100.
//1 <= A[i] <= 10000.
//1 <= K <= A.length.
//Answers within 10^-6 of the correct answer will be accepted as correct.

//In a N x N grid representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.

//0 means the cell is empty, so you can pass through;
//1 means the cell contains a cherry, that you can pick up and pass through;
//-1 means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.
//Your task is to collect maximum number of cherries possible by following the rules below:

//Starting at the position (0, 0) and reaching (N-1, N-1) 
//by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value 0 or 1);
//After reaching (N-1, N-1), returning to (0, 0) by moving left or up through valid path cells;
//When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up and the cell becomes an empty cell (0);
//If there is no valid path between (0, 0) and (N-1, N-1), then no cherries can be collected.

//Example
//Example 1
//
//Input: grid =
//[[0, 1, -1],
// [1, 0, -1],
// [1, 1,  1]]
//Output: 5
//
//Explanation: 
//The player started at (0, 0) and went down, down, right right to reach (2, 2).
//4 cherries were picked up during this single trip, and the matrix becomes [[0,1,-1],[0,0,-1],[0,0,0]].
//Then, the player went left, up, up, left to return home, picking up one more cherry.
//The total number of cherries picked up is 5, and this is the maximum possible.

//Example 2
//
//Input: grid =
//[[0, 1, -1],
// [-1, 0, -1],
// [-1, -1,  1]]
//Output: 0
//
//Explanation: 
//We can't from (0,0) to (2,2).

//Notice
//grid is an N by N 2D array, with 1 <= N <= 50.
//Each grid[i][j] is an integer in the set {-1, 0, 1}.
//It is guaranteed that grid[0][0] and grid[N-1][N-1] are not -1.

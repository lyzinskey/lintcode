//Given a positive integer, output its complement number. 
//The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

//Example
//Example 1:
//
//Input: 5
//Output: 2
//Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. 
//So you need to output 2.

//Example 2:
//
//Input: 1
//Output: 0
//Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. 
//So you need to output 0.

//Notice
//1.The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
//2.You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

//There are a number of spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. 
//For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. 
//Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. 
//Start is always smaller than end. There will be at most 10^4 balloons.

//An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis. 
//A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart ≤ x ≤ xend. 
//There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. 
//An arrow once shot keeps travelling up infinitely. 
//The problem is to find the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

//Example
//Example1
//
//Input:
//[[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]]
//Output:
//2
//Explanation:
//One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]) 
//and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two balloons).

//Example2
//
//Input:
//[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
//Output:
//4

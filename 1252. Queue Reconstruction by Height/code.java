//Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. 
//Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), 
//where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person 
//who have a height greater than or equal to h. 
//Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

//Example
//Example1
//
//Input:
//[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]
//Output:
//[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]

//Example2
//
//Input:
//[[2,0],[1,1]]
//Output:
//[[2,0],[1,1]]

//Notice
//The number of people is less than 1,100.

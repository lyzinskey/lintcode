//Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], 
//reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. 
//Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

//Example
//Example 1:
//
//Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
//Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"].

//Example 2:
//
//Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
//Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"].
//Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"]. But it is larger in lexical order

//Notice
//1.If there are multiple valid itineraries, 
//you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. 
//For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
//2.All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
//3.You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.

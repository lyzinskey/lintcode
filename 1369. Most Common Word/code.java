//Given a paragraph and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word that is not in the list of banned words. 
//It is guaranteed there is at least one word that isn't banned, and that the answer is unique.

//Words in the list of banned words are given in lowercase, and free of punctuation. 
//Words in the paragraph are not case sensitive. The answer is in lowercase.

//Example
//Example1
//
//Input:  paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit." and banned = ["hit"]
//Output: "ball"
//Explanation:
//"hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
//"ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. 
//Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
//that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"), 
//and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.

//Example2
//
//Input:  paragraph = "a a a b b c c d" and banned = ["a","b"]
//Output: "c"
//Explanation:
//"a" and "b" are banned words
//"c" occurs 2 times and "d" occurs only once
//So output "c"

//Notice
//1 <= paragraph.length <= 1000.
//1 <= banned.length <= 100.
//1 <= banned[i].length <= 10.
//The answer is unique, and written in lowercase 
//(even if its occurrences in paragraph may have uppercase symbols, and even if it is a proper noun.)
//paragraph only consists of letters, spaces, or the punctuation symbols !?',;.
//Different words in paragraph are always separated by a space.
//There are no hyphens or hyphenated words.
//Words only consist of letters, never apostrophes or other punctuation symbols.

//We are given a 2-dimensional grid. "." is an empty cell, "#" is a wall, 
//"@" is the starting point, ("a", "b", ...) are keys, and ("A", "B", ...) are locks.

//We start at the starting point, and one move consists of walking one space in one of the 4 cardinal directions. 
//We cannot walk outside the grid, or walk into a wall. 
//If we walk over a key, we pick it up. 
//We can't walk over a lock unless we have the corresponding key.

//For some 1 <= K <= 6, 
//there is exactly one lowercase and one uppercase letter of the first K letters of the English alphabet in the grid. 
//This means that there is exactly one key for each lock, and one lock for each key; 
//and also that the letters used to represent the keys and locks were chosen in the same order as the English alphabet.

//Return the lowest number of moves to acquire all keys. If it's impossible, return -1.

//Example
//Example 1:
//
//Input: ["@.a.#","###.#","b.A.B"]
//Output: 8
//Explanation：[0,0]->[0,1]->[0,2]->->[0,3]->[1,3]->[2,3]->[2,2]->[2,1]->[2,0]

//Example 2:
//
//Input: ["@..aA","..B#.","....b"]
//Output: 6
//Explanation：[0,0]->[0,1]->[0,2]->[0,3]->[0,4]->[1,4]->[2,4]

//Notice
//1 <= grid.length <= 30
//1 <= grid[0].length <= 30
//grid[i][j] contains only '.', '#', '@', 'a'-'f' and 'A'-'F'
//The number of keys is in [1, 6]. Each key has a different letter and opens exactly one lock.

//Write a class StockSpanner which collects daily price quotes for some stock, 
//and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.

//The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days 
//(starting from today and going backwards) for which the price of the stock was less than or equal to today's price.

//For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85], 
//then the stock spans would be [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6].

//Example
//Example 1:
//
//Input: prices = [100,80,60,70,60,75,85]
//Output: [1,1,1,2,1,4,6]
//Explanation: 
//First, S = StockSpanner() is initialized.  Then:
//S.next(100) is called and returns 1,
//S.next(80) is called and returns 1,
//S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
//S.next(70) is called and returns 2,
//S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
//S.next(75) is called and returns 4,
//S.next(85) is called and returns 6.
//
//Note that (for example) S.next(75) returned 4, because the last 4 prices
//(including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.

//Example 2:
//
//Input: prices = [50,80,80,70,90,75,85]
//Output: [1,2,3,1,5,1,2]
//Explanation: ï¼š
//First, S = StockSpanner() is initialized.  Then:
//S.next(50) is called and returns 1,
//S.next(80) is called and returns 3
//S.next(70) is called and returns 1
//S.next(90) is called and returns 5
//S.next(75) is called and returns 1
//S.next(85) is called and returns 2

//Notice
//Calls to StockSpanner.next(int price) will have 1 <= price <= 10^5.
//There will be at most 10000 calls to StockSpanner.next per test case.
//There will be at most 150000 calls to StockSpanner.next across all test cases.
//The total time limit for this problem has been reduced by 75% for C++, and 50% for all other languages.

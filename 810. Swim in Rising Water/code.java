//On an N x N grid, each square grid[i][j] represents the elevation at that point (i,j).

//Now rain starts to fall. 
//At time t, the depth of the water everywhere is t. 
//You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square 
//if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most t. 
//You can swim infinite distance in zero time. 
//Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

//You start at the top left square (0, 0). What is the least time until you can reach the bottom right square (N-1, N-1)?

//Example
//Example 1
//
//Input: [[0,2],[1,3]]
//Output: 3
//Explanation:
//At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
//You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.
//You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
//When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.

//Example 2
//
//Input: [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
//Output: 16
//Explanation:
// 0  1  2  3  4
//24 23 22 21  5
//12 13 14 15 16
//11 17 18 19 20
//10  9  8  7  6
//
//The final route is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 16 -> 15 -> 14 -> 13 -> 12 -> 11 -> 10 -> 9 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6.
//We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.

//Notice
//2 <= N <= 50.
//grid[i][j] is a permutation of [0, ..., N*N - 1].

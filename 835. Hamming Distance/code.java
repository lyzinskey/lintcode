//The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
//Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

//Example
//Example1
//
//Input: x = 1 and y = 4
//Output: 2
//Explanation:
//The binary representation of 1 is 001
//The binary representation of 4 is 100
//There are 2 different bits

//Example2
//
//Input: x = 5 and y = 2
//Output: 3
//Explanation:
//The binary representation of 5 is 101
//The binary representation of 2 is 010
//There are 3 different bits

//Notice
//0 â‰¤ x, y < 2^31

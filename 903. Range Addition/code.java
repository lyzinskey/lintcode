//Assume you have an array of length n initialized with all 0's and are given k update operations.

//Each operation is represented as a triplet: [startIndex, endIndex, inc] 
//which increments each element of subarray A[startIndex ... endIndex] (startIndex and endIndex inclusive) with inc.

//Return the modified array after all k operations were executed.

//Example
//Given:
//length = 5,
//updates = 
//[
//[1,  3,  2],
//[2,  4,  3],
//[0,  2, -2]
//]
//return [-2, 0, 3, 5, 3]
//
//Explanation:
//Initial state:
//[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
//After applying operation [1, 3, 2]:
//[ 0, 2, 2, 2, 0 ]
//After applying operation [2, 4, 3]:
//[ 0, 2, 5, 5, 3 ]
//After applying operation [0, 2, -2]:
//[-2, 0, 3, 5, 3 ]

    We update the value at start index, because it will be used when we are adding up the values for the sum at each index 
    between start index and end index (both inclusive). 
    We update the negative value at the end index + 1, 
    because the positive value of it should be only added at its previous indices (from start index to end index). 
    Thus, when we accumulate the sum at the end for each index, 
    we will get the correct values for each index. 
    If the end index is the last index in the resulting array, 
    we don't have to do the end index + 1 part, 
    because there is no more index after the last index and there will be no error when we accumulate the sum.
